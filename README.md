# Spinnin' player
This is an app designed to simulate the early/mid-2010s Spinnin' Records audio-only YouTube videos, where the album cover is absurdly zoomed in and just pans around with a half-transparent banner showing the info and "OUT NOW!"

[What I mean: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuFUtL8zUAk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuFUtL8zUAk)

Obviously, it's not 1:1, I made it just for fun. You can turn any song you have into a Spinnin' style video with this, how cool, right?!

# How to use
